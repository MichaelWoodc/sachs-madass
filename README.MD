The things to consider when modifying your bike:
1. A larger oil cooler means you will need to run your bike before checking the oil, as you want to check the oil level with the oil cooler completely full.  Reading it without running the engine first risks underfilling the oil level.
2. Without a fuel pump, the location of the fuel petcock and gas tank can create inadequate fuel flow at lower fuel levels for larger carburetors that sit higher on the bike, thus further reducing range and usable fuel capacity.  
3. Many big bore kits from pit bikes will fit this engine, so performance can be upgraded relatively easily!
